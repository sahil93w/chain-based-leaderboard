# Chain-Based Leaderboard Contract

## 1. Project Title:
**Chain-Based Leaderboard Contract**

## 2. Project Description:
The Chain-Based Leaderboard Contract is a simple Clarity contract designed to store and manage player scores on a decentralized leaderboard. It allows the addition of scores for players and retrieval of player scores. The data is immutable and transparent, providing a trustless environment for ranking players or users.

This contract is ideal for applications like gaming, quizzes, or competitions where usersâ€™ performance needs to be ranked and stored securely on the blockchain.

## 3. Project Vision:
The vision for this project is to create a decentralized, immutable, and transparent leaderboard for ranking players based on their performance. It aims to provide an easy-to-use, scalable solution for applications that need a secure leaderboard system. By using blockchain technology, this system ensures that scores are tamper-proof and transparent.

## 4. Future Scope:
- **Sorting and Ranking:** Implement functions to retrieve top N players in descending order based on their scores.
- **Leaderboard Tiers:** Support multiple types of leaderboards, such as daily, weekly, or regional.
- **Time-based Restrictions:** Introduce features like score expiry or periodic leaderboard resets.
- **Player Profile Information:** Extend the contract to store player metadata, such as name, avatar URL, or achievements.
- **Multi-Game Support:** Allow users to store scores from multiple games or activities within the same contract.
  
This contract can serve as the foundation for a wide range of applications that require a leaderboard system.

## 5. Contract Add:
The contract contains two core functions:

### **1. `add-player-score`**:
   - **Purpose:** Allows adding or updating a player's score.
   - **Inputs:**
     - `player (principal)`: The unique identifier (principal) for the player.
     - `score (uint)`: The score to be added for the player (must be a positive integer).
   - **Outputs:** Returns `true` if the score was successfully added.

### **2. `get-player-score`**:
   - **Purpose:** Retrieves the score of a specific player.
   - **Inputs:**
     - `player (principal)`: The unique identifier (principal) for the player.
   - **Outputs:** Returns the score of the player, or an error if no score is found for that player.

;; Chain-Based Leaderboard Contract
;; A simple contract for storing player scores on a leaderboard.

;; Define the leaderboard
(define-map leaderboard principal uint)

;; Error Codes
(define-constant err-invalid-score (err u100))
(define-constant err-score-not-found (err u101))

;; Add Player Score
(define-public (add-player-score (player principal) (score uint))

;; Get Player Score
(define-read-only (get-player-score (player principal))
  (match (map-get? leaderboard player)
    some (ok (unwrap! (map-get? leaderboard player) err-score-not-found))
    none (err err-score-not-found)))
